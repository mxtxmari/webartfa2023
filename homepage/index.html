        <p>Hello hello. Is this where my intro would go? I'm so confused still very much so. How did I get here? Where did my passion take me? I guess my works can tell my story. My legs took me through a journey, I crawlwed, walked, ran, jumped, hopped and skipped, and tumbled down. And throughout the process, I made worked with films folks to create dance films. I guess I', a film folk too now. My hands were busy too, making props, sets, setting up cameras, lighting, carrying everything to and fro the large vans with expensive equipment, which I somehow learned how to operate along the way. I choreographed and directed, made people dance, made them look silly but important, make them feel things. I made them feel emotions so people watching can too. That's kinda cool. </p>
